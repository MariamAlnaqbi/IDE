what is IDE?
An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines
common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).

An IDE typically consists of:
-Source code editor: A text editor that can assist in writing software code with features such as syntax highlighting with visual cues, providing language specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as code is being written.
-Local build automation: Utilities that automate simple, repeatable tasks as part of creating a local build of the software for use by the developer, like compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.
-Debugger: A program for testing other programs that can graphically display the location of a bug in the original code.
